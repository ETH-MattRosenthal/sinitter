Sinitter
========

Snitter is a sinatra application to demonstrate how to integrate with Twitter OAuth via the twitter_oauth gem.  You can see it running at http://sinitter.moocode.com/

Setup
======

To run the application locally you'll need to create a Twitter OAuth Application.  This is available at http://twitter.com/oauth_clients/new.

Once your application is setup you will have a cosumer key and consumer secret.  Create config.yml in the root of sinitter eg.

consumer_key: YOUR-CONSUMER-KEY
consumer_secret: YOUR-CONSUMER-SECRET
